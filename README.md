# Myosotis

What if you could send a conversation to someone, block them from all contact
and only if they figured out the right questions, would they get the answers you
had lined up? Finally, your insight would be beyond doubt. Your wisdom
immortal. Your utter disregard for the value of their time illustrated beyond
refute.

Myosotis was designed to let you leave behind conversations, to only those that
you want to, in your own time. 

You design questions and answers, publish a blob of nonesense - only those armed
with a key and the right questions can extract what is left for them. 

Currently, it does none of that. But we'll get there.

## PS:
The crypto here is kinda hard. I'm gonna get it wrong. Don't use this
irresponsibly. You rascal, you.
